# Design Phases

**not everything with any linearity is a "waterfall"**

nor do your want "iterative development"

**iterate** == Latin for _do over_

better: **incremental** _grow into_

more like a hike up the (understanding) mountain, not always up, 
but trending up

being able to name **phase** _appearance_ helps with _where are you at?_

not monotonic - ok! **stay open-minded**

- this is when change is cheapest

**be explicit about backtracking**

# Phases

_these are words with a D this time_

- **[Describe](chapter_12.md)** (situation)
- **[Diagnose](chapter_14.md)** (possible problems)
- **[Delimit](chapter_17.md)** (the problem you are going to solve)
- **[Direction](chapter_19.md)** (strategy, approach)
- **[Design](chapter_28.md)** (tactics, implementation plan)
- **[Dev](chapter_30.md)** (build it)

at any time:
- **Decide** (to do, or not)
