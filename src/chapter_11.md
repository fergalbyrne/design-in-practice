# Design Phases

**not everything with any linearity is a "waterfall"**

nor do your want "iterative development"

**iterate** == Latin for _do over_

better: **incremental** _grow into_

more like a hike up the (understanding) mountain, not always up, 
but trending up

being able to name **phase** _appearance_ helps with _where are you at?_

not monotonic - ok! **stay open-minded**

- this is when change is cheapest

**be explicit about backtracking**

# Phases

_these are words with a D this time_

- **Describe** (situation)
- **Diagnose** (possible problems)
- **Delimit** (the problem you are going to solve)
- **Direction** (strategy, approach)
- **Design** (tactics, implementation plan)
- **Dev** (build it)

at any time:
- **Decide** (to do, or not)
