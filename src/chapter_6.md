# Technique: The Socratic Method

**interrogate** _ask together_

examine an idea dispassionately

questioning its underlying assumptions, consistency

**dispassionate** _without suffering_

- you are not your idea
- you are a source of ideas, some better than others

**we don't define/opine the truth, we discover it**
