# DM Cells: <span style="font-weight: 300">Aspects</span>

**of approach per criterion**

**succinct description** of how approach handles criterion (or doesn't)

avoid y/n/true/false/numeric-rank criteria, and in cells

**avoid judgement in text**, instead use (unsaturated!) cell background color
- Neutral - clear
- Some challenge or negative - yellow
- Seems blocking or failing to address problem - red
- Seems particularly desirable/better - green

# DM Cells: <span style="font-weight: 300">Aspects (cont.)</span>

Can start with just 'pros' and 'cons' rows/cells
- but important to split up later 
- only then are criteria explicit 
- and all approaches judged similarly

**Contrast** - _stand against_

**edges are primary triggers of perception**
