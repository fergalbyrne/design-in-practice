# Objective - Demystify Design

Not (just) going to the hammock

**practice** - _what you do_

concrete techniques with tangible outputs

demonstrable **progress** - _walk forward_

activities you can make PM stories out of

- thus make time for, throughout the dev process
- not pleading for 2 weeks of nebulous "hammock time" up front

valuable artifacts that make the effort evident

tips and techniques, not a formal method or anything highfalutin'
