# Words

**Choose good words**, _all the time_

not about bikeshedding or premature marketing

precision in naming == precision in thinking 
(**precision**: _before+cut_)

**eschew nicknames, superheroes etc**
- not semantic/meaningful
- give cover to fuzziness
- don't track evolving thinking

be **succinct** _gird, gather up_

- brief, clear and complete
- not just **concise** _cut off_, or merely hinted at

----

# More Words

**use the dictionary** (not just for writing keynotes)

**go right to the origins**

- most useful/abstract semantics
- discover the composition within words

a good words later becoming wrong could mean:
- you've changed your mind without acknowledging it
- you are drifting from your intentions

**your thinking will evolve and your words (story titles etc) should also**
