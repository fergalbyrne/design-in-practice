# Objective - Demystify Design

Not (just) going to the hammock

**practice** - _what you do_

concrete techniques with tangible outputs

demonstrable **progress** - _walk forward_

activities you can make PM stories out of

- this make time for, throughout the dev process
- not pleading for weeks of nebulous "hammock time" up front

valuable artifacts that make the effort evident

tip and techniques, not a formal method or anything highfalutin'


~~~admonish warning
A beautiful stylish message:
```clojure
(defn testy []
    "Hello World!)
```

```java
public static void testy() {
}
```
