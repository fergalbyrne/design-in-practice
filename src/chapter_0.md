# Chapter 0 - Traditional Databases

It's quite likely that most readers of this book simply take for granted what a "traditional
database" is, mostly because these databases have become the default in the 25 years since the
dot-com era. This chapter is aimed at explaining the most important characteristics of a traditional
database system, including the reasons for the most important design choices behind them.

```admonish note
Newer database architectures claiming to solve some of the issues with traditional 
RDBMS's will be dealt with shortly.

### What a Database System is for
A database system is used when you have a requirement in your computer system to _record_, _process_, and _make decisions_ about
_information_ whose size is larger than will fit in your computer's memory. 

It's really the fact that the database (the collection of information)
is so large that requires a system to handle it - we already have programming languages to manipulate
the data in memory, but to do the same for abitrarily large collections of information, we need 
a system (and often a different language) to do the same job.

The situation is similar to that of computers themselves. Computers programs carry out logical and arithmetical operations
on data, but the programs only contain instructions for the computer's CPU. The CPU has only a handful
of _registers_ with which to carry out the operations, way too few to do anything non-trivial. So we 
have programming languages that allow us to carry out "operations" on data that is housed in memory. Our "instructions"
are automatically turned into many real instructions that are mostly loads, stores and address calculations, giving us 
the illusion that our programs are operating on things in the much larger space of memory.

The database system gives us the illusion that we can run similar "programs" on data sets which are much larger than our 
computers' memory can hold. 

Clearly this job is substantially more complicated than that done by
our programming languages: after all the assembly languages of 1949-50 (which use only the real instructions) were partially replaced
in FORTRAN by 1954 and completely in C by 1972 or so, with languages like Rust and Go now giving
approaching the holy grail of maximum performance and close-to-optimal safety. In contrast, the world of
database systems continues to be a frontier territory where everything is a compromise and 
complexity in juggling cross-cutting concerns seems a fact of life.

Traditional databases are typically Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS). Whether
they are commercial systems like Oracle, or Open Source systems like MySQL (and variants) or Postgres,
they share the same set of major characteristics. 

The choices behind these designs made good sense in a world that looked like this (VAX 11/780, late 1970's):

| Fact (at the time)                                | Typical Value                   | Some Consequences                                                                                                                                            |

| Requirements change slowly | quarterly                       | Once written, queries and/or stored procedures can remain unchanged for years |

Obviously things have changed substantially in the several decades since the late 1970's, but 
importantly they changed quite incrementally between then and now. As a result, the designers 
and developers of RDBMS systems have modified their designs one step at a time to take advantage 
of the improvements as they occurred. We'll take note of these changes as we go along.

Let's go into a bit more detail about some of these aspects:

~~~admonish info title="'item' of information"
In this discussion, we'll be thinking of the information in the database as consisting of many small,
aggregates of atomic or primitive values, which we'll call *item*s. For example, the information
about me might include my first and last names, which would each be a string-valued item.
In Clojure we'd represent my information something like this:
```clojure
(def fergal-info 
  {:first-name "Fergal" :last-name "Byrne" ...})
```
~~~

### Update In Place

Due to the high cost of hard disks back in the day, the storage available for your data was very 
limited, so it made sense to store the data in a way where each item of data was in a _single place_
in the larger store of items.

When new data came in, consisting of new _values_ for these items, what you would do is go to the _place_
for each item and overwrite the old value with the new,  a strategy known as __update in place__. 

Several things fall out from this. First, for each potential item of information, _there is a place_: each 
item has some sort of coordinates telling you how to either find the current value or where to
write in a new value. In a traditional RDBMS, the coordinates are expressed as `<Table>.<Row>.<Column>` (see below).

Secondly, because there's only one place for a value, you can only store the current value in that place, and any
previous values will disappear unless you do something else to record them. Later, as disks became
bigger and bigger, we could start keeping some copies of the old data, for example in places called
_shadow tables_ - these improvements were sometimes supported by the RDBMS, sometimes roll-your-own, and always pretty
optional.

Thirdly, the layout or **schema** of the database should avoid having multiple copies of an item. For example,
in an eCommerce system, every `Order` has a customer, but we don't want to store the customer's first name
and last name along with each of their orders - instead we'll store those in a single place for `Customer`s, and
refer to that customer using the `customer-id` (this is called a **foreign key** as it is a key used in the `Order` for another 
kind of data - the `Customers`). There is literally a whole theory of designing databases around these 
concepts, and a database in the right layout is described as being in _normal form_.

### A Client-Server Architecture - "It's _Over There_"

The extreme of this is the dumb terminal remote-controlling the central mainframe or minicomputer, but from the 1980's the 
typical business app running on a microcomputer, PC or workstation operated by compiling queries to send to
the RDBMS and get back results in some binary form, all over a _connection_ to the RDBMS.

### Structured Query Language (SQL) - a string-based interface

### Tables, Rows and Columns - 'coordinates' for items and 'shapes' for data


### ACID Transactions

- **A**tomic - either all operations in the transaction occur, or none of them
- **C**onsistent - 
- **I**solated
- **D**urable

### Indexes
