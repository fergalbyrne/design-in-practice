# Technique: <span style="font-weight: 300">Reflective Inquiry</span>

Not (just) going to the hammock

|                         | Understanding             | Activity             |
|-------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| **Status** _to stand_   | What do you know?         | Where are you at?    |
| **Agenda** _to be done_ | What do you need to know? | Where are you going? |

this is a framework that can be applied throughout the design process

**note the importance of thinking about your thinking**

**reflect** _bend back_

_inquiry - advancing knowledge, is the driver_
