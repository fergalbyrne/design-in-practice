# DM Columns: <span style="font-weight: 300">Approaches</span>

first row or two describe approach

- must give you shorthand for talking, yet make clear what about
- **succinct description** of approach, use row 2 if needed
- freeze the approach title/description rows
  
if you are modifying something, the first 'approach' should be the status quo 

columns for what others have done in same situation

and your initial ideas

A DM is about **creating** a great approach, not merely shopping

**the answer is often an approach you don't begin with**
