**build it**

You **understand why** you are making the thing - solving this problem
You **know how** to make it - few or no unknowns
You are **confident it will work**
- lots of supportive material
- keeps you on track
- facilitates adding others to team

**the solution will be _smaller_ and _more general_ due to having designed it**

Have at, with your dev toolkit and techniques

**but don't build something on the same day you think of it**
