# Phase: <span style="font-weight: 300">Diagnose</span>

_know across_ **possible problem(s), of two kinds**

1. **bugs/defects**
   - yes bugfixes need design (or revisions of a design)
   - lest you just play symptom/code whack-a-mole
2. **features**


| What do you know?    | What do you need to know? | Where are you at?               | Where are you going?                                                                   | 
|----------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| the symptom, context | the cause(s)              | have good description, evidence | <ul><li>applying logic and experimentation</li><li>to **explicate** _unfold_</li></ul> |

# Diagnose: <span style="font-weight: 300">Bugs</span>

**symptom &rightarrow; possible problems &rightarrow; (likely) problem**

**hypotheses** (more than one)

pick one (how?)

- use logic first (to rule out)
- "most likely" (intuition)
- makes the problem space smallest (divide and conquer)

Use the Scientific Method
