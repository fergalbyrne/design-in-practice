DM: Tips
Avoid
- **the all-green column** - are you rationalizing? 
- **undistinguished columns** - find the differences that matter 
- **exhaustive or template rowsets** - s.b. specific criteria, not just characteristics 
- **links as primary cell content** - ok as supplement to summary text in cell 
- **hidden comments/popups etc** - keep things in view 
- **phrasing criteria as questions** - clash with inline questions

include questions as soon as they arise!

put '?' anywhere (approach/criterion/aspect)
- if you are unsure of importance
- or the info is unknown
