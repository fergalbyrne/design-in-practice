# Technique: <span style="font-weight: 300">Scientific Method</span>

**Succinct statement of unmet user objectives and cause(s)**

not symptoms/anecdotes/desires

not remedy/solution/feature - challenge is to filter out

modify your top story Title from symptom &rightarrow; problem

add Problem after the Description in the top story - link to diagnosis work

**subject to refinement**
- as your understanding increases
- don't let your problem statements get stale

**This is the most important artifact you will have**

_if you don't relentlessly focus on a problem you may make something that doesn't solve any problem_
